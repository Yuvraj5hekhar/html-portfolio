  <h1>About me :</h1>
<hr>
<p style="background-color: gold;">
  Hi, I'm <span style="color: red;">Yuvraj Shekhar</span>, currently a student at Thompson Rivers University. I'm passionate about Computer Science and am working towards achieving my Bachelor's degree. I'm dedicated to learning and growing in my field, with a particular interest in artificial intelligence and software development.

  Outside of my studies, I enjoy coding, playing video-games, and going to gym. These activities help me stay balanced and energized. One memorable experience that shaped who I am today is when I set a personal goal to lift a certain amount of weight on the bench press. It was a challenging target, but through dedication and perseverance, I was able to achieve it, which taught me the value of setting goals and pushing through challenges.
</p>
<p style="background-color: gold;">
  I believe in continuous learning and innovation, and I strive to make a positive impact. My goal is to make a positive impact through my efforts and contributions.
